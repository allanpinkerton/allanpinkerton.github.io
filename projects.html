                    This page is a general overview of all my projects and contains a breif description and links to the source code.
                    It seems that Unity does not work very well with git, so I don't have the source to my Unity games hosted here. One day, I might put them on Dropbox and link it here, but for now, you'll have to email me to request a copy ):
                </p>

                <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>
                <br />
                <p>Currently, I am working on implementing a library of assorted algorithms in Go. The purpose of this project is to understand the algorithms better through implementing, while learning Go in the process. I would also analyze these algorithms for complexity, actual running time, and memory usage.
                  The plan for this project is to begin with classic comparison model sorting, then move on to some non-comparison based sorting algorithms (to beat the nlog(n) lower bound). After that, I will look into string manipulation algorithms, such as Longest Common Subsequence, Longest Increasing Subsequence, etc. The next step would be to implement geometry related algorithms, such as Closest Pair, Extreme Points, and the Convex Hull Problem.</p>
                <p>For details and source code, please view the <a href="https://github.com/allanpinkerton/algorithms-go">Github page</a> for this project.</p>

                <h3 id="helicon">Helicon</h3>
                <p>
                    Helicon is a to-do list like time management app on Android. The main feature that will be added to the app is the ability to "predict" how long certain tasks will take based on previous tasks.
                    For example, if you took 3 hours to complete Math249 Assignment 1 and 2 hours to complete Math249 Assignment 2, then the program would guess that Math249 Assignment 3 would take a similar amount of time (2-3 hours).
                    Due to the sheer size and amount of work required, the project has been put on hold either until I could find someone else to cooperate with or until I have more spare time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are interested, the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/allanpinkerton/helicon">Github</a>, with more details on which features still need to be implemented.

                <h3 id="Criminal Intent">Criminal Intent</h3>
                <p>
                    Criminal Intent is a toy app on Android that keeps track of "office crimes" and is the first non-trivial app that I worked on. I created it following the examples in Big Nerd Ranch's Android Programming book, and it is intended as a learning material and a playground for me to practice and familiarize with various features of the Anroid API such as fragments, photo taking, sending messages, etc. Not surprisingly, Helicon bears semblance to this app and inherits many of the design and patterns used in this app.

                <h2 id="unity">Space Shooter</h2>
                <br />
                <p>Space Shooter is a vertical scroller that I made using Unity. This progam is my main testing ground for Object Oriented Design Patterns. It utilizes the Decorator pattern to allow weapon upgrades for the user's ship. The AI for the enemy uses the Strategy pattern to allows the enemy to take on different moving patterns, based on the difficulty level, at runtime. From object to module, everything was written to maximize reusability.</p>
                <p>The game features 3 different types of enemies, each with their unique method of attack, two distinct weapon upgrades, and a point system.<p>
